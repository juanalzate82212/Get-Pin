Detective, one of our team members tracked our target, Vincent the thief, to a hidden warehouse. 
We believe this is where he's storing the stolen goods. The entrance to this warehouse is guarded by a digital combination lock.
However, our informant isn't entirely certain about the PIN they witnessed Vincent input.

The keypad has the following layout:
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 7 │ 8 │ 9 │
└───┼───┼───┘
    │ 0 │
    └───┘

He noted the PIN 1357, but he also said, it is possible that each of the digits he saw could actually be another adjacent digit
(horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). E.g. instead of the 1, it could also be the 2 or 4.

And instead of the 5, it could also be the 2, 4, 6, or 8.

He also mentioned he knows this kind of lock. You can enter an unlimited amount of wrong PINs, but they never finally lock
the system or sound the alarm. That's why we can try out all possible variations.

All possible in the sense of the observed PIN itself and all variations considering the adjacent digits.

Can you help us to find all those variations? The array should contain all possible PINs ordered in ascending value.

Detective, we are counting on you!

Input: PIN in string format

Output: Array of strings (the observed pin itself should be included in the array)
